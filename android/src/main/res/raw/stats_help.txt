<b>OPR</b> (Offensive Power Rating) is a team's estimated average contribution to their alliance
match scores, assuming match scores are the sum of just the alliance teams' contributions.

<b>DPR</b> (Defensive Power Rating) is a team's estimated average contribution to opposing alliance
match scores, assuming match scores are the sum of just the opposing teams' contributions. Lower is
better.

<b>CCWM</b> (Calculated Contribution to Win Margin) = OPR - DPR.

These stats are an interesting way to slice the data for teams at a particular event, but aren't a perfect system for assessing a team's performance or contribution.
