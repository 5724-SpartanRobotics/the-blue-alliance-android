<b>OPR</b> (Offensive Power Rating) is a team's estimated contribution to their alliance match
scores, assuming match scores are a linear combination of just the alliance teams' contributions.
This is very roughly 1/3 of the average alliance scores. Higher is better.

<b>DPR</b> (Defensive Power Rating) is a team's estimated contribution to opposing alliance match
scores, assuming match scores are a linear combination of just the opposing teams' contributions.
This is very roughly 1/3 of the average opposing alliance scores. Lower is better.

<b>CCWM</b> (Calculated Contribution to Win Margin) = OPR - DPR. A team's expected net contribution
to an alliance.

These stats are an interesting way to slice the data for teams at a particular event but aren't a
perfect system for assessing a team's performance or contribution.
